    <p>
        I apologize sincerely for the unfinished nature of this site you've been directed to visit; I am working diligently on creating 
        this more professional and complete version of my portfolio site, but in the meantime, feel free to visit my 
        <a href="https://github.com/Svagtlys">GitHub repositories</a> or my <a href="https://svagtlys.github.io/htmlPortfolioPage">old website</a>. 
        Thank you for your understanding!
    </p>

        Please note that no parts of this design are final. I like the book theme, as it reflects a large part of how I became who I am, 
        but I'm not a big fan of the fonts and colors yet.
